## Introduction
Understanding the intricacies of computer architecture is essential for optimizing the performance of modern processors. This repository showcases a series of projects designed to deepen understanding of various computer architecture concepts through practical implementation.

## Projects

### Branch Predictor
The branch predictor project implements various branch prediction algorithms to enhance instruction pipeline efficiency by reducing the number of pipeline stalls caused by branch instructions.

### Cache Memory Simulator
This project involves creating a cache memory simulator that models the behavior of different cache configurations. It helps in understanding cache misses, hits, and the overall impact on system performance.

### Dynamic Instruction Flow
The dynamic instruction flow project simulates the out-of-order execution of instructions, allowing for better utilization of CPU resources and improved performance by dynamically scheduling instructions based on availability.

### Instruction Scheduling
This project focuses on instruction scheduling between multiple cores and threads, optimizing the execution order to maximize CPU utilization and throughput.
